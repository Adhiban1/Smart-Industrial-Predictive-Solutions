## Introduction
This is Feynn Labs Internship's 3rd project. Here, we have to choose one best project of all our 1st projects.

Then need to do:
- Data collection
- Data analysis
- Machine learning
- Creating business model
- Creating finantial equation with the help of data analysis and machine learning. 
- If possible, we have to create app.

## Workflow
- Getting details of 1st project of each member
- Selecting one project from our 1st project
- Or selecting new best project topic other than our projects
- Building business model, creating financial equation, collecting data, doing data analysis & Machine Learning
- Developing web or desktop or mobile app (optional)

## Project Evaluation Matrix for Feasibility, Viability, and Monetization

- **Feasibility:** Product/Service can be developed in short term future. (2-3 years)
- **Viability:** Product/Service should be relevant or able to survive in long term future. (20-30 years)
- **Monetization:** Product/Service should be monetizable directly. (indirectly monetizable Product/Service should be dropped for this Project)

| Project Title                              | Feasibility (2-3 years) | Viability (20-30 years) | Monetization                   |
|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Machine Predictive Maintenance for Industrial Machines | Feasible                | Viable                   | Direct monetization through maintenance services |
| Personal Medical Assistant                   | Less feasible           | Potential viability      | May require complex monetization strategies |
| University Chances Predictor                | Feasible                | Viable                   | Subscription services or partnerships |
| Clothing Recommendation System Based on Body Data  | Feasible                | Viable                   | Monetization through affiliate marketing or personalized shopping experiences |
| College Recommender                         | Feasible                | Viable                   | Subscription services or partnerships |

### (Scale: 1-5)

Here's a table with the project titles, along with their respective ratings on a scale of 1 to 5 for Feasibility, Viability, and Monetization, where 5 indicates the highest rating and 1 indicates the lowest:

| Project Title                              | Feasibility | Viability | Monetization |
|--------------------------------------------|-------------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Machine Predictive Maintenance for Industrial Machines | 5                 | 5               | 5                   |
| Personal Medical Assistant                   | 2                 | 3               | 2                   |
| University Chances Predictor                | 4                 | 4               | 4                   |
| Clothing Recommendation System Based on Body Data  | 4                 | 4               | 4                   |
| College Recommender                         | 4                 | 4               | 4                   |
